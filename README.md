MERN is an acronym for Mongodb, Express, Node.js and React.js. They are all used together to make web applications. Node.js and Express are use collectively to serve the back-end while Mongodb is used to store data. The frontend is built using React. All four technologies are JavaScript based which is primarily why they are used together. The instaClone application is deployed using Heroku which is a cloud platform used to get the apps to the market. 

## Approach Taken
Our approach taken initially was to break up the project into front-end and back-end. When we started working on the project further we separated the project into parts that each team member decided to focus on. 

## Notes 
If there was more time we would add more functionality to the feeds, and profile pages. As well as adding email authentication and password security functionality.
